- make the login secure by sending a nonce before request, then md5'ing the uname/pw/nonce to sign in
- make the cljs interface
- make @ completion match even when its not the first thing
- fix/redo @ completion, its too hard to think about right now
- connect this server to the rabbitmq bouncer that I still have to set up
